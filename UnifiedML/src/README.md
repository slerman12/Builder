# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](../../tributaries-ml/src/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](../../minihydra/src/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

```console
pip install UnifiedML
```

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

[//]: # (> This work is an effort to create the best of all worlds in ML: accelerated, accessible and easy, state of the art, and general, to meet every ML need and then some. The purpose of a generalist agent is reflected by the expression "to be greater than the sum of parts". For each task in a pool of learnable tasks, a singular agent may learn to better generalize not just on each one individually[1^], but on altogether new tasks[^2] due to the generalization of their inter-related and transferable knowledge-components. In the future, this library will be the easiest way to reproduce ML feats like [Imagen]&#40;&#41; and [Stable Diffusion]&#40;&#41;, not to mention [GATO]&#40;&#41;. In the meantime, I ask for you to [sponsor]&#40;&#41; this work and help in any way to provide me compute and resources and support for realizing the full potential of this "library". UnifiedML is much more than a library.)
