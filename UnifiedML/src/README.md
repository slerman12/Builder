# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

#

[See full documentation here.](https://agi-init.github.io/UnifiedML) (Documentation in progress)

[//]: # (TODO: Maybe change "base: import" to "task:" to simplify and perhaps "model:" instead of architecture parts. )


# Get started

To start a train session, use the ```ML``` command:

```console
ML
```

Defaults:

```dataset=MNIST```

```task=classify```

Plots, logs, generated images, and videos are automatically stored in: ```./Benchmarking```.
