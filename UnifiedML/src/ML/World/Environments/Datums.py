class Datums:
    """
    Envs must:
    (1) include **kwargs as an init arg
    (2) have a step(action) function
    (3) have a reset() function

        The step() and reset() functions output experiences ("exp")
            i.e. dicts containing datums like "obs", "action", "reward", 'label", "done"

        In the step() function, instead of outputting one experience, can output a (prev, now) pair of experiences.
        Some datums, such as reward, are time-delayed and specifying them in a separate "prev" experience makes
        it possible to pair corresponding pairs without time-delay for metrics and Replay.

        The end of an episode or epoch may be marked by the "done" boolean. If unspecified, it will be assumed True
        during step() calls.
            - This sequence demarcation can be useful for tabulating metrics (e.g. based on multiple steps or an epoch
              of batches) or for the automatic organizing of temporal data in Replay.

            - The "done" step doesn't get acted on. Its contents can be a no-op (either output None or just
              {'done': True}), or, if you're using (prev, now) pairs, the prev experience in a done state should still
              include any additional datums needed for logging or storing in Replay, such as "reward". It shouldn't
              include the "done" key. The now state, which should hold the "done" key or be None, is ignored.
            - The reset() state can't ever be a "done" state even if you specify it as such. In that case,
              output None from your step() function.

    Envs can:
    (1) have an obs_spec dict
    (2) have an action_spec dict
    (3) include a render() method, frame_stack(obs) method, and/or an action_repeat init arg that Env should adapt to
        and include as a self.action_repeat int attribute

        (1) and (2) if you want custom inout/output spec info to be passed to your Agent/Model (as dicts/Args).
        The Environment infers many input/output specs by default. For example, obs_spec.shape often isn't necessary
        since it can be inferred from an "obs"-key value of the reset() function. action_spec.shape from a "label" if
        present.

        - For obs_spec, besides "shape", these stats can include for example: "shape", "mean", "stddev", "low", "high".
        Useful for standardization and normalization.

        - For action_spec, these stats can include for example: "shape", "discrete_bins", "low", "high", "discrete".
        For discrete action spaces and action normalization. Many of these can be inferred,
        and see Environment.py "action_spec" @property for what the defaults are if left unspecified.

        All of this is optional and doesn't have to be used / can be ignored. Include obs_spec and action_spec as
        args in your agent/model's __init__ method to get access to the configured specs of the Env.

        See DMC.py and Atari.py for examples of frame_stack(obs) and action_repeat. Used commonly in RL.
        Video logging online rollouts can be facilitated by the render() method. Also can be ignored.

    Datasets must:
    (1) extend Pytorch Datasets
    (2) output (obs, label) pairs, or dicts of named datums, e.g., {'obs': obs, 'label': label, ...}

        Accessed in the API via dataset= or test_dataset=, or via env.dataset= / env.test_dataset=

    Datasets can:
    (1) include a "classes" attribute that lists the different class names or classes

        This allows quick and exact computation of number of classes being predicted from, without having to count
        via iterating through the whole dataset.
