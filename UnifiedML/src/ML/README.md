# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](../../../tributaries-ml/src/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](../../../minihydra/src/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

```console
pip install UnifiedML
```

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

# Terrible Purpose

The terrible purpose of UnifiedML is to de-centralize the autonomous-agent training process. The reality is, it's becoming easier than ever to create technology for mass good and mass evil. In the hands of centralized elite, these learning systems are used for capitalistic gain. That includes autonomous weaponry and other exploitative measures, extending to mass surveillance. In the hands of people, we can train robotic agents to do amazing things with some creativity and ingenuity. Drones that fish for us (with line, hook, and lure over the waters), drones that provide moving de-centralized internet or cell service, quadrupeds that carry packs up mountains and through hikes, delivery drones, distribution drones, all solar powered, all self-powered and engineered safe for their design purpose. The elite won't build these things (at least not for consumer) because they aren't profitable to sell. An endless, free supply of healthy organic fish? That's not a good business idea. Selling compute to the Department of Defense? That is.

UnifiedML is the best machine learning library in the world, even without the ethical utopian spiel. It's accelerated, general, and exceptionally-sufficient to the training of any robotic, predictive, or intelligent agent, made for both the small scale (esoteric small-lab research projects) and the large scale (foundation models, unified models, and generalist agents). It's fast and made for you, humanity, and the community-rather-than-corporate driven rise of general AI. Like [GATO](), except open-source.

As a demonstration of this library's range and power, let's train a neural network generalist agent to simultaneously learn to play a video game (in this case, the Nintendo classic, Mario) and classify the computer vision gold-standard ImageNet:

```console
ML multi_task='["task=RL Env=Mario", "Dataset=ImageNet dataset.root=imagenet/"]' Eyes=ResNet50
```

Rather, not de-centralization of training, but de-centralization of power. Power for food production, power for self-autonomy/determination.

Later, after we've built the civilization of our dreams together, we have to ask whether keeping these technologies, much like the fated Ring of Power in the Lord of the Rings is even in our collective best interest. I think not. Eventually, after having used these tools that exist for mass good rather than mass evil, to build the infrastructure for a utopian world in a sustainable way self-powered by solar and clean energy, we can discard them. For that, we need a common shared language, set of interpretations, and vision/purpose. The objective isn't met until every individual is happy. That is our goal, the world as a satisfiability problem, and the search space optimizations of AI-empowered human wise-decision-making as its NP-hard solution.

[See full docs here.]()

Part of what makes UnifiedML unique is that it's designed to be easy, so that everyone with vision and good understanding can use these tools, not just those with the specialized, often discriminative or barrier-inducing mindset that some people are not able to acquire even through extremely hard work.

Why do we need generalists and "general AI" for fish drones and quadruped companions? We maybe don't. But the tools are better in our hands and open-source than where they currently exist: in for-profit DARPA funded/affiliated institutions that have no such vision and would easily allow their engineers to make something that would directly be sold to the nearest military vendor.

What stops them from doing that with an open-source UnifiedML? Can't this technology be used maliciously by those institutions? Answer: we've released this under the MIT license. That means anything they do with it (especially commercially), any derivative, has to be made public and under the same license. Mutually assured destruction stops them. Proliferating weapons of mass destruction is usually a bad idea, leading to cold war. Releasing the schematics for a nuclear reactor has proven not to be, leading to more-clean energy. In the hands of elite, war; in the hands of average scientists, energy/research. De-centralizing is safer than centralizing, and it's already centralized.

Beyond "artificial" intelligence, these tools can be used to greater understand intelligence more generally. To that end, we think it can connect us further to nature, not further from it.

And frankly I'm not sure about any of this either, but I trust my own ethics. Moreover, I trust that something important is being built and that I'm just a small part of it. Maybe one day I'll be quoting Oppenheimer/the Bhagavad Gita in saying "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." I hope not. I hope the opposite. I hope our 10,000 years of technological progress --- 300,000 if we can date it to as far back as fire --- can culminate in an actual human utopia, an actual Garden of Eden. The Tower of Babel supposedly divided humanity into thousands of languages in an effort to unify us and bring us together and to "heaven". If Babel means anything, it means "babble" as in "bla bla bla". That's what large language models are doing. That's what all of us are doing. I don't know if UnifiedML is another Tower of Babel or if we can gear towards some direction of human purpose this time, find our roots in nature, and genuinely build utopia, which we certainly have the technology for and *can*.

I welcome everyone to use this library for good and hope no one will use it for the creation or preservation of pain and suffering in humanity.

Why not just build the good technologies instead of releasing this? Because I neither have the funding nor the support. There are many people who feel emotionally driven to immediately implement good ideas as soon as they hear/devise of them. I’m funded by a spiritual potency that drives me sometimes and otherwise doesn’t. For now, it gives me the strength and urge to build this and I trust that there’s a reason, in addition to the above reasons that I believe I believe. I have gotten no credit or rewrad for my smaller ideas and my life has been hell. Medical issues, trauma, sociopolitical circumstances and disadvantages. I can either flop dead like a fish or work in the direction that my physiology literally physically lets me. I don’t like the work and I’d rather collect data for line-hook-lure fish drones at some serene river in nature with friends. If I had all the money, I would devise a contraption to make the fish suffer the least possible, such as (naively) a morphine release module. But since that wouldn’t actually prevent pain and terror much I imagine, more likely a contraption that kills the fish instantly. A baited wall with a lure sticking out from which steel blades can emerge to enwrap around and claw the fish. Instant, painless death. Is that harsh? yes. But I feel bad for the fishies. I think people need meat and will get meat anyway. So I’d like to build a contraption that autonomously helps individuals, in a de-centralized manner, get unlimited healthy meat in nature. But the consciousness experience of fish is something we don’t know or udnerstand well, and to cause extreme pain and terror in an entire universe of consciousness --- perhaps at scale --- is a warcrime against the Godhead.

Also, for what it’s worth, I know “Babel” stems from Babylonia.
