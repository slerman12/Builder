# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](../../../tributaries-ml/src/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](../../../minihydra/src/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

```console
pip install UnifiedML
```

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

# Terrible Purpose

The terrible purpose of UnifiedML is to de-centralize the autonomous-agent training process. The reality is, it's becoming easier than ever to create technology for mass good and mass evil. In the hands of centralized elite, these learning systems are used for capitalistic gain. That includes autonomous weaponry and other exploitative measures, extending to mass surveillance. In the hands of people, we can train robotic agents to do amazing things with some creativity and ingenuity. Drones that fish for us (with line, hook, and lure over the waters), drones that provide moving de-centralized internet or cell service, quadrupeds that carry packs up mountains and through hikes, delivery drones, distribution drones, all solar powered, all self-powered and engineered safe for their design purpose. The elite won't build these things (at least not for consumer) because they aren't profitable to sell. An endless, free supply of healthy organic fish? That's not a good business idea. Selling compute to the Department of Defense? That is.

UnifiedML is the best machine learning library in the world, even without the ethical utopian spiel. It's accelerated, general, and exceptionally-sufficient to the training of any robotic, predictive, or intelligent agent, made for both the small scale (esoteric small-lab research projects) and the large scale (foundation models, unified models, and generalist agents). It's fast and made for you, humanity, and the community-rather-than-corporate driven rise of general AI. Like [GATO](), except open-source.  

As a demonstration of this library's range and power, let's train a neural network generalist agent to simultaneously learn to play a video game and classify the computer vision gold-standard ImageNet:

```console
ML multi_task='["task=RL Env=Mario", "Dataset=ImageNet dataset.root=imagenet/"]' Eyes=ResNet50
```

Rather, not de-centralization of training, but de-centralization of power. Power for food production, power for self-autonomy/determination. 

Later, after we've built the civilization of our dreams together, we have to ask whether keeping these technologies, much like the fated Ring of Power in the Lord of the Rings is even in our collective best interest. I think not. Eventually, after having used these tools that exist for mass good rather than mass evil, to build the infrastructure for a utopian world in a sustainable way self-powered by solar and clean energy, we can discard them. For that, we need a common shared language, set of interpretations, and vision/purpose. The objective isn't met until every individual is happy. That is our goal, the world as a satisfiability problem, and the search space optimizations of AI-empowered human wise-decision-making as its NP-hard solution.

[See full docs here.]()

Part of what makes UnifiedML unique is that it's designed to be easy, so that everyone with vision and good understanding can use these tools, not just those with the specialized, often discriminative or barrier-inducing, mindset.
